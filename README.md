# Gulp starter with materialize.css

This was built from [animsaj](https://github.com/animsaj/gulp-materialize-starter) started, and I decided to fork hers and starter from there as a way to provide credit.

## Resources Included:

- materialize.css
- materialize.js
- Pug sample page
- Sass sample code
- Fonts referred by cdn, so font folder is empty. 

## Gulp Tasks:

On the gulp side there are utilities listed bellow

- compile sass
- live browser reload
- concat css into one file and minify it
- concat js into one file and minify it
- minify images
- cache minified images
- send all above into a dist folder + copy fonts
- clean unused files

Remember to do run the `npm install` command after cloning this repo :)
