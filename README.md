# Gulp starter with materialize.css

## Gulp Tasks:

On the gulp side there are utilities listed bellow

- compile sass
- live browser reload
- concat css into one file and minify it
- concat js into one file and minify it
- minify images
- cache minified images
- send all above into a dist folder + copy fonts
- clean unused files
- ESLint javascript code

## How to use:

1. Clone to your desktop.
2. Run `npm install`.
3. Run `gulp` to generate the project and be able to make changes as needed.
4. Stop the gulp, and run `gulp build` to build your site.
5. Copy the dist directory to your server and you are set.
